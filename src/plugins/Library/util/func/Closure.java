/**
** An object representing a partially-evaluated subroutine. This is useful in
** many situations, for example when we have a general subroutine that takes
** several parameters, and we want to create a derivative subroutine for which
** a subset of these parameters is fixed (this is sometimes referred to as the
** "environment"). The derivate is sometimes called a "curried function".
**
** This idea can be applied to implement continuations in an algorithm that
** blocks waiting for some of its parameters to arrive.
**
** This interface defines a checked exception to be thrown from the {@link
** #invoke(Object)} method; if you call it on a general {@code Closure} then
** you will also need to catch {@link Exception}. If you don't need to do this,
** use {@link SafeClosure} instead.
**
** (Unfortunately, using a type paramater to indicate the type of exception
** thrown is unacceptable; the signature {@code throws T} disallows throwing
** multiple types of exception, whereas {@code throws Exception} allows it.)
**
** @param <P> Type of the input parameter. If you need more than one input
**        parameter, consider using the classes in {@link Tuples}.
** @param <E> Type of the thrown exception(s). If your implementation throws
**        more than one type of exception, it's recommended to give the closest
**        superclass of all the exceptions, though {@link Exception} is always
**        safe. If your implementation throws no checked exceptions, consider
**        using {@link SafeClosure} instead of this class.
