		** Returns the average perceived relevance of a given term relative to
		** a parent subject term. "Perceived" because it uses data from indexes
		** in the WoT's nearer rings; "average" because it generates an average
		** rating from the individual values encountered.
		**
		** The value is calculated from the mean of all the relevance values
		** encountered for this subject-term pair (with the weights /
		** probabilities being the normalised trust score of the index which
		** defined the pairing), multiplied by 3. (Values greater than 1 are
		** normalised back down to 1).
		**
		** For example, if we have encountered 9 indexes all with equal weight,
		** and 2 of them defined rel(S, T) = 0.5, then this method will return
		** 0.5 * min(1, 3*2/9) = 1/3.
		**
		** In other words, if less than 1/3 of the total index trust-mass gives
		** a relevance rating for a given subject-term pair, the value returned
		** by this method will be lower (than it would be if more indexes had
		** had supplied a rating).
		**
		** We choose 1/3 as an arbitrary compromise between majority-ignorance
		** (most people might not know obscure term X is related to obscure
		** term Y) and minority-attack (one person might inject information to
		** distort a search query; we shouldn't expect WoT to deal with minor
		** corner cases). '''This value can be discussed further'''.
		**
		** Formally, let
		**
		** : S := subject
		** : T := term
		** : A := { all indexes encountered }
		** : R := { i &#x220A; A: i.rel(S, T) is defined }
		** : W<sub>i</sub> := weight of index i (eg. WoT trust score)
		**
		** Then this method calculates:
		**
		** : (&Sigma;<sub>i&#x220A;R</sub>W<sub>i</sub>&middot;i.rel(S, T))
		**   &middot; min(1, 3&middot;&Sigma;<sub>i&#x220A;R</sub>W<sub>i</sub>
