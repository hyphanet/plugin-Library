/**
** A comparator that is consistent with the identity operator on objects. The
** ordering is arbitrary, but consistent with the general contract for
** compare methods. This is useful when you want to have a sorted collection
** like {@link SortedSet}, but want to be able to have two objects (that would
** otherwise compare equal) to be present in the collection simultaneously.
**
** This implementation will remain consistent even if it encounters two objects
** with the *same* identity hash code, by assigning a unique 64-bit id to each
** distinct object, as it encounters such objects.
**
** Since identity hashcodes are generated arbitrarily by the JVM, the ordering
** imposed by this comparator will change between different runs of the JVM.
** Hence, the exact ordering must not be treated as an instrinsic or immutable
** property of the underlying collection.
**
** The intended use of this class is for another class to subclass it, or to
** have a {@link Comparable#compareTo(Object)} call the method of the singleton
** provided in the {@link #comparator} field.
