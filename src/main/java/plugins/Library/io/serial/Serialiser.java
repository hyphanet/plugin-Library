/**
** An empty marker interface for serialisation classes. It defines some nested
** subclasses that acts as a unified interface between these classes.
**
** Nested data structures such as {@link plugins.Library.util.SkeletonBTreeMap}
** will generally use the metadata of their children directly (ie. without
** using a {@link Translator} during a serialisation operation. Therefore, it
** is recommended that all metadata passing through this class (and related
** classes) be directly serialisable by an {@link Archiver}. This will make the
** task of writing {@link Translator}s much easier, maybe even unnecessary.
**
** The recommended way to ensure this is for it to be either: a primitive or
** Object form of a primitive; an Array, {@link Collection}, or {@link Map},
** where the elements are also serialisable as defined here; or a Java Bean.
**
** TODO NORM restructure this class, maybe split off into a Serialisers class,
** or a serial.serialiser package...
